        Choosing the lesser of evils, whether in voting or in philosophical
        decision making, is a point of contention. Do you stick to your
        principles? Or do you stray from them for the sake of persuasion?
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no right or wrong answer. But research shows that we must
        compromise on our own ideas if we want to convince people of our ideas.
        It&rsquo;s a counter-intuitive way of thinking, but once you start to
        understand it, it becomes natural.

      <h2>Morals Are Not Universal</h2>
      <p>
        People like Ayn Rand, Stefan Molyneux and Walter Block have always
        insisted on the existence of an objective set of morals. Even insisting
        that their beliefs are the objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the more you study the ideas of others, the easier it is to realize
        that there is no universal morality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morality has always varied between cultures. The foundations of those
        morals are reactive and adaptive in nature. They stem from fear and
        survival rather than rationale.

          moral foundations theory

        Jonathan Haidt and Craig Joseph propose six foundations of moral
        reasoning. Care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haidt argues that progressives focus only on care and fairness,
        libertarians stress only liberty and fairness, and conservatives stress
        all six equally.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details of the moral roots of conservatives and liberals are
        explained in further detail in Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s TED talk.

      <p>
        The research behind the moral foundations theory says that when members
        of a political camp hear the words and see the behavior of the other,
        they see it as self-interested or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        They don&rsquo;t see the perspective of those speaking the words or
        taking the action. They perceive it from their moral standpoint. They
        are <strong>blind to the moral foundations of others.</strong> We all
        experience this when we look at those with different moral foundations
        than our own.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Can&rsquo;t We All Agree?</h2>
      <p>
        The reason why we can not see the perspective of others with different
        morals, as with many sociological theories, stems back to the
        hunter-gatherer societies of our ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three elements unique to conservatives; loyalty, authority, and
        sanctity, bind groups together through strength and tribal competition.
        In the modern world, those principles translate to war, trade
        restrictions, and geopolitics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Libertarians and liberals both argue that maintaining these principles
        is unnecessary in the modern world. Conservatives argue that human
        nature is still a factor and that natural competition and conflict will
        never go away.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand this difference in thinking, the difference between aiming
        for <strong>internal growth</strong> vs geopolitically{' '}
        <strong>fighting &lsquo;external threats&rsquo;</strong> to maintain
        dominance, Haidt suggests that humans have evolved what he calls a

        The hive switch suggests the ability to switch between ape-like
        competitiveness and bee-like cooperativeness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have formed larger groups overtime to compete against other large
        groups. The difference in thinking between independent competition and
        group competition is, to an extent, what separates liberals and
        conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conservative thinking, the individual must pull their own weight for
        the survival of the group. In progressive thinking, the group must take
        care of the individuals for the survival of the group. In libertarian
        thinking, the individual must find the best course of action for
        themselves for the survival of the group. Same goal, different
        perspective, different morals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liberals are morally concerned about care. Libertarians about liberty.
        And conservatives about loyalty and sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s nearly impossible for one group to imagine what it&rsquo;s
        like to think like someone with a different moral standing. The
        phenomenon that makes it difficult to see another&rsquo;s moral
        perspective is a &ldquo;moral empathy gap.&rdquo;

          empathy gap
        </NextLink>{' '}
        in the social sciences &ldquo;is a cognitive bias in which people
        underestimate the influences of visceral drives on their own attitudes,
        preferences, and behaviors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, when you are angry, it is hard to understand what
        it&rsquo;s like not to be angry. In a moral empathy gap, when you are
        outraged by police killing innocent people, it is hard to understand
        what it&rsquo;s like to be happy that police are patrolling the streets.
        When you&rsquo;re happy that police are patrolling the streets, it is
        hard to understand what it&rsquo;s like to hate the police because of a
        few shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking another moral perspective requires a conscious effort that we
        naturally do not do in every situation. It is not easy to change your
        own moral perspective to gain a greater understanding of the whole
        picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moral foundations theory research suggest that moral principles come
        from a genetic disposition and is influenced by upbringing. People may
        cross political party lines, but it&rsquo;s unlikely that their moral
        foundations have ever changed.

        It is possible to close the moral empathy gap and get better at

      <p>
        That previous article on the libertarian image problem summarizes many
        cognitive biases and heuristics. It also proposes{' '}
        <strong>deep canvassing</strong> as a way to change people&rsquo;s minds
        by talking to them in an empathetic way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideas mentioned there are no different than the ones here. What the
        moral foundations&apos; theory provides is a way to see and understand
        the ideas of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deep canvassing is a way to discover someone&rsquo;s moral principles.
        It gives you a perspective on where they&rsquo;re coming from. Listening
        and having a conversation has been proven to have a greater effect on
        changing someone&rsquo;s mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all know this to be true. But so often people tend to make arguments
        based on their own moral values instead of making an attempt to
        understand who they&rsquo;re talking to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often people speak the argument that would persuade them. Not the
        argument that would persuade the person they&rsquo;re talking to.
      </p>
      <h2>Use Your Understanding to Persuade</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to remember that people will not sacrifice their own
        moral values in favor of yours. If you want someone to understand your
        ideas. If you want to convince someone of your ideas. You need to be
        able to put them in the perspective of <strong>their</strong> values,
        not <strong>yours</strong>.

          Framing
        </NextLink>
        , in the social sciences, &ldquo;comprises a set of concepts and
        theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups and societies,
        organize, perceive, and communicate about reality.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Arguing from the frame of whomever you are arguing with is &lsquo;
        <strong>moral reframing</strong>.&rsquo; The writing and marketing
        industries have always used the idea of moral reframing. But somehow it
        has not extended into the political world, and that&rsquo;s the major
        issue I&rsquo;m getting at here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider who your target audience is.</strong> Who do you want
        to convince of your ideas? What kind of language do they use? What are
        their beliefs, their interests, their morals? What do they respond to?
        With the answers to these questions, you can reframe your arguments and
        perspectives into the terms that are most effective. To gain the answers
        to those questions, all you need is a little deep canvassing and
        listening skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obvious objection here is compromise. Sticking to your principles
        100% can, and usually will have a negative impact on your persuasive
        abilities.
      </p>
      <h2>Is Compromise Worth It?</h2>
      <p>
        At some point, you will have to compromise if you want to convince
        someone of an idea. This means softening your message to get a single
        point across about one policy or issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the question becomes; is this a net negative on the message as a
        whole? Or is it getting people to take their first step in the right
        direction when they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to be persuasive, you&rsquo;re going to have to use terms
        you don&rsquo;t agree with. For example, to convince a conservative that
        gay people should be able to get married you might tell them that gay
        people pay taxes, fight in the military, and obey the laws. They deserve
        the right to marry just like every other loyal American.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that argument wrong? Even if it works? Or is the opposition to that
        argument in itself an example of the blindness and refusal to accept
        other people&rsquo;s perspectives?
      </p>
      <p>
        We will continue the conversation on those questions below and on social
        media. The decision to step away from the soapbox and have a
        compromising conversation for the sake of a gentle push in the right
        direction is up to you.
