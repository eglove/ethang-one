        Fighting that battle isn&rsquo;t easy. I fought a case in which a

        opened an investigation on the officer who issued it. The court
        recognized that the statute did not cover the accusation put against me.

        Fighting the enemy starts with knowing them and how they operate.

        The following is the summary of two very recent Supreme Court cases.
        Birchfield v. North Dakota was heard in April 2016 and Utah v. Strieff
        was heard in February 2016. The first sets an important limit on fourth
        amendment searches. The second gives police a dangerous amount of power
        to harass and &ldquo;legally&rdquo; conduct illegal searches in high
        crime areas. The purpose of going over them here is to understand the
        context of their decisions, the dangers they present to freedom, and
        hopefully{' '}
        <strong>
          expose avenues to fight or help others fight the precedent they set.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h2>Birchfield v. North Dakota Oral Arguments</h2>
      <p>
        In Birchfield v. North Dakota, three men in three different cases
        refused to submit to a blood test for blood alcohol level. The state
        charged all three with a criminal offense for asserting their fourth
        amendment right. The question here is whether it is a criminal offense,
        not whether it is a violation. The truth of the matter is that{' '}
        <strong>
          the federal government has no jurisdiction to protect your right to
          free travel
        </strong>
        , it&rsquo;s not in the constitution. At best, it can stop states from
        taxing you&nbsp;for, or preventing you&nbsp;from leaving a state to go
        to another. But there is no constitutional right to travel within a
        state or on its roads. For this reason, both the court and the
        Petitioner (Birchfield) recognized that the state can take away a
        person&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license for a refusal to submit to a blood
        test. That admission alone brings up a lot of issues. Primarily, is
        getting a driver&apos;s license a voluntary agreement to the rules of
        the road, and consent to any search given reasonable suspicion?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;You know, that especially in North Dakota and sparsely populated
        States, you have to drive in order to &mdash; so we know that consent is
        &mdash; is fictional in that sense. But suppose that it was voluntary
        and that it was explained and so forth and the &mdash; and the &mdash;
        and the drivers sign it. It still seems to me you&rsquo;d &mdash;
        you&rsquo;d have an argument that it&rsquo;s &mdash; it&rsquo;s
        coerced.&rdquo; -Justice Kennedy
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If the state has a monopoly on licensing for the use of roads, and if
        they can refuse to license someone, or take a license away without
        reason (which they can do), then why do they need consent to search
        someone driving on the roads they have full control over?{' '}
        <strong>
          The lack of a right to travel on a federal level has left a large and
          dangerous power gap between the state and the people.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;Assume a State can condition the &mdash; the ability to drive on
        a State&rsquo;s roads on consenting to a blood-alcohol test, perhaps
        under certain circumstances. Let&rsquo;s say this is done in writing at
        the time when the person applies for the license, so it&rsquo;s not
        &mdash; it&rsquo;s not just implied. Why does that &mdash; what is
        different about that situation from a number of other situations that I
        can think of? For example, conditioning a &mdash; a license to operate
        an interstate passenger train on submitting to a blood-alcohol test in
        the event of reasonable suspicion. The person is operating the &mdash;
        the train under the influence of &mdash; of alcohol, or the same thing
        with someone who is operating aircraft. Or suppose there were a law that
        said that if you want to enter certain government buildings, such as
        this building, the &mdash; the condition of entering is consenting to a
        search, and you have to sign something, you have to go through the
        magnetometer. And then if a person got through that, and there was
        reasonable suspicion that the person had smuggled in some kind of a
        weapon, the person would be subjected to a search. What would be the
        difference between that situation and this situation?&rdquo; -Justice
        Alito
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s hard to deny the logic. The{' '}
        <strong>
          state has already secured the power to submit people to searches in
          many areas.
        </strong>{' '}
        In the case of blood alcohol tests, evidence dissipates over time. A
        refusal could mean time for a suspect to sober up.{' '}

          The Chimel Rule
        </NextLink>{' '}
        allows for warrantless searches of an arrested person for safety, escape
        prevention, and destruction of evidence. While this may only apply to
        arrested persons, an officer may conduct a field sobriety test based on
        reasonable suspicion in order to obtain probable cause for an arrest.
        And then conduct a warrantless search for BAC (Blood Alcohol Content).
        In any case, the state holds the power.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The North Dakota
        statute strikes a bargain with individuals who wish to use the
        State&rsquo;s public roads. Conditioning their use thereon, on consent
        to a blood-alcohol test, if arrested for drunk driving, the Court has
        held that this is a valid bargain, and that States may enforce it with
        the imposition of significant consequences, including license revocation
        and the use of test refusal as evidence in criminal proceedings.&rdquo;
        -Thomas R. McCarthy, North Dakota
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;What about another bargain, if people find that texting while
        driving is becoming an increasing problem, and so when you get a
        license, you&rsquo;re &mdash; you give implied consent for the officer
        to look at the texts or whatever they can look at on your cell phone to
        make sure, you know, a minute ago you were texting somebody while
        driving? Is &mdash; would that be acceptable under your
        rationale?&rdquo; -Justice Roberts
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As North Dakota asks for more power by a decision of the Supreme Court,
        the potential for a slippery slope becomes clear.{' '}
        <strong>
          If getting a license is implied consent to a search, isn&rsquo;t it
          implied in all cases, not just DUI suspicions?
        </strong>{' '}
        When the Respondent (North Dakota) claimed that getting a
        warrant&nbsp;makes their job more difficult. Justice Sotomayor snapped
        back by telling them to get a warrant anyway. On the argument that
        magistrates aren&rsquo;t always available at odd hours, she responded:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;So that excuses you from a constitutional requirement?
        We&rsquo;re now going to bend the Fourth Amendment, which I always
        thought started on the presumption that we favor warrants, we
        don&rsquo;t disfavor them. But since many jurisdictions seem to manage
        it, we give a pass to North Dakota because it doesn&rsquo;t want
        to?&rdquo; -Justice Sotomayor
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The point is reinforced,{' '}
        <strong>
          if the state already has the power to suspend someone&rsquo;s license
          based only on or less than suspicion, why then do they need to conduct
          any further search?
        </strong>{' '}
        Justice Sotomayor suggested that there is another, underlying goal here
        for the state.&nbsp;And that the argument doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
        Indeed, it is likely that North Dakota&rsquo;s representatives believe
        they should be able to search anyone at any time without jumping through
        any hoops to make sure there is no misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a 7-1 decision, the Supreme Court decided that{' '}
        <strong>
          in order to do a blood test for BAC, a warrant is required.
        </strong>{' '}
        However, because of the perceived difference in privacy violations, they
        reaffirmed that a warrant is not required to do a breathalyzer test,

        personal lives, what we do in our own homes, and how we trade with
        others, nowhere are the violations of natural human rights more visible.
        But by understanding the state&rsquo;s limits on what they can and

        can better understand where to take the fight.

      <h2>Utah v. Strieff Oral Arguments</h2>
      <p>
        In Utah v. Strieff, a police officer doing a sting on a suspected drug
        house stopped Strieff who was coming out of the house and discovered an
        outstanding warrant during questioning. After the arrest for that
        warrant, the officer found meth on Strieff. The defense argues that the
        detainment was illegal, to begin with. While the arrest may be legal,
        the evidence recovered during the search is not admissible because the
        officer obtained it under illegal means. If he found evidence by illegal
        means, it falls under the{' '}

        and it is not admissible&nbsp;in court. The issue is,{' '}
        <strong>
          if an illegal detainment, by pure chance, turns up a warrant, does
          that cancel out the exclusionary rule?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of Ferguson, Utah, the city was openly issuing arrest
        warrants for minor violations to the point that 80% of the population
        had outstanding warrants. (Really, 80%.){' '}
        <strong>
          The city was then using those warrants as an excuse to investigate
          anyone with a minor suspicion.
        </strong>{' '}
        Just to justify searches. The state legal representative fully
        recognized this and did not argue against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joan Watt, the representative for Strieff, argued that allowing officers
        to stop people,&nbsp;solely to check for warrants when they have no
        suspicion, <strong>would destroy the fourth amendment.</strong> Both
        sides agree on the legality of a{' '}

        </NextLink>
        , which says police may stop people&nbsp;and frisk them&nbsp;based on
        reasonable and articulable suspicion. What&rsquo;s at issue is if they
        can stop people without that suspicion, just so they can check for a
        warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justice Roberts brought up a comparison to traffic stops. Officers
        usually run people&rsquo;s plates before approaching the vehicle as a
        matter of safety. He asks, how is that, on a legal basis, any different?
        Is there a difference between checking warrants for safety and checking
        warrants for investigation? However, it&rsquo;s made clear that{' '}
        <strong>
          police can not pull people over&nbsp;without reasonable suspicion
        </strong>
        , to begin with. This is why in New Hampshire at a traffic stop,
        passengers are not considered detained, but the driver is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justice Alito showed resistance to the case by clarifying that the
        arrest was lawful because of an outstanding warrant. And that the search
        was lawful due to the arrest. But the{' '}
        <strong>
          evidence found during that search was the fruit of unlawful
          detainment.
        </strong>{' '}
        Even if the officer has reason to believe Strieff was just exiting a
        drug house, proximity to a suspicious place does not justify a lawful

          Justice Sotomayor dissented
        </NextLink>{' '}
        by writing that this case allows police officers to take advantage of
        their own unconstitutional conduct. In areas that have high rates of
        outstanding warrants (such as 80%), this ruling incentivizes officers to
        conduct unlawful searches (for which they will most likely not be
        challenged) in the hopes of finding a warrant. A direct contradiction of
        the purpose of the fourth amendment. She wrote that
        <strong>
          {' '}
          the ruling creates a &ldquo;second-class&rdquo; of citizens who are
          now subject to police misconduct based on whims and guesses.
        </strong>{' '}
        People in cities like Ferguson, Utah, who we know the city subjected to
        unjustified warrants, are now vulnerable to harassment and searches at
        any time without any suspicion that they&rsquo;ve committed a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this second case, Justice Sotomayor is rightfully recognizing that
        government power is rarely challenged by those most subject to it. If
        officers have the power to stop people without suspicion, based on the
        gamble that there is an outstanding warrant, they will use it.{' '}
        <strong>
          It is important to resist power on the street by asserting your rights
          and within the courts by defending your own peaceful actions.
        </strong>{' '}
        Some people have found the idea of clogging the courts with victimless
        cases to be reprehensible. But if people challenge tickets more often,
        they&rsquo;ll be less likely to receive them for transient reasons, and
        officers will more likely use their own discretion and judgment to seek
        the safety of the community rather than revenue collection.

        No matter your political beliefs, blindly giving into every accusation
        the state throws at you gives them power you don&rsquo;t want to give
        them.{' '}
        <strong>
          If you stop fighting, the government will keep grabbing power.

        Something simple you can do to help yourself, the people who have been
        arrested for selling products, feeding those in need, singing, and
        dancing. For the people who have serious victim-based cases that do not
        get speedy trials because of a broken system with backward priorities.
        One simple thing you can do to help shift this balance of power back in
        favor of the people is to always defend yourself when you were not in
        any moral wrong in any peaceful manner possible. Show the courts you
        won&rsquo;t stand for a lack of officer discretion and obvious revenue
        collection tactics. Keep yourself educated, and don&rsquo;t take the
        plea.
