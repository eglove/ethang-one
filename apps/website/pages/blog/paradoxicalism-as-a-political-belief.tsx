        I&apos;ve been taking the time to actually learn about a wide variety of
        beliefs. I&apos;ve been taking on a detached point of view. I&apos;ve
        stopped allowing myself to respond before I have full empathy for what
        I&apos;m hearing. For the most part, this has resulted in me rejecting
        my established libertarian anarchist beliefs. But it hasn&apos;t
        resulted in me taking on a new political identity . If someone were to
        ask me what I am in a political context, I wouldn&apos;t have a clue. In
        fact, on most specific issues, I would admit total ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1-2 years ago I would plug whatever the issue is into a For A New
        Liberty style framework. I would &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the issue by
        framing it in a utopian anarcho-capitalist world.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I wrote Open Source Government in 2014, I was first exploring the
        idea of anarchy as a system of competing governments. Not tied to any
        geographical location. When I wrote You&apos;ll Never Have Your Anarchy
        in 2015, I was first recognizing the fact that human nature doesn&apos;t
        change just because government goes away. People will still call for gun
        control after shootings. They&apos;ll still want to illegalize drugs and
        gay marriage. Your neighbors don&apos;t suddenly change just because the
        system they live under does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, in 2018, I have to admit that I&apos;m questioning my status as
        an anarchist. I&apos;ve never denied the need for governance. Police,
        court, systems of discipline and reparation. Posse justice is not
        justice. But I have to recognize the need for society to collectively
        work on problems other than those involving violence.

        Let&apos;s use an easy example. The black rhino was once considered to
        be extinct because surveys could not find any in the wild. Poachers were
        killing them in mass for their valuable horns. The solution was to allow
        hunters like{' '}

          Corey Knowlton to kill one
        </NextLink>{' '}
        for a very large amount of money. Knowlton killed an old rhinoceros that
        was both killing other males, and incapable of reproducing. Africa got
        $350,000 for rhino conservation and enforcing poaching laws. Something
        they would not have gotten from tourism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Libertarians held this up as an example of the great governing force of
        capitalism. But the legal hunters weren&apos;t shooting any or as many
        rhinos they wanted. They weren&apos;t taking the horn and leaving the
        corpse to rot. Only poachers, who hunted with only greed in mind, did
        so. Even today, poaching decimating populations is a problem. But the
        black rhino population is making huge gains due to regulated hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Libertarians have this idea that the best way to conserve a species is
        to farm them. Period. But farming doesn&apos;t address the actual issues
        of endangerment and extinction. When a species leaves a natural
        environment and stops interacting with it, it has far-reaching
        consequences on the whole ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulated rhino hunting happens in the wild. The anarcho-capitalist
        would say that all land, including the wild where these rhinos live
        naturally, should be privately owned. But that&apos;s unrealistic and
        doesn&apos;t solve the problem. Poachers don&apos;t care about the
        boundaries and rules of public land. They&apos;re not going to care
        about the boundaries and rules of your private land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor does it address the issue of the greed of poachers to begin with.
        They can buy up land and hunt animals to extinction because in anarchy
        it is the property owners who are king. They can make their money, throw
        it into a decent investment account, and be set for life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea that greed isn&apos;t a problem here because it goes against
        self-interest can go right back where it came from.
      </p>
      <p>
        What saved the black rhino was capitalist policy enforced by government.
        On wild land owned and regulated by society as a whole. Government saved
        the black rhino.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so we get to my current conundrum. In order to understand the
        beliefs of others, I have to take a look at human nature . Something
        anthropologists like Steven Pinker and psychologists like Jordan
        Peterson have helped me do. On one hand, the bigger the government, the
        more corruption you get. A one-world government isn&apos;t bad in
        theory. But it offers no way out of corruption. There is no one to stop
        bad actors in power. Or to stop good actors in power from becoming bad
        actors. Which is inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, that inevitability is what causes multiple
        governments to go to war with one another. Or to play the game against
        and in competition with one another. To the detriment of its own
        citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no government, people still group up. Influence spreads. You could
        make government illegal to watch out for that sort of thing. But you
        would need a government to enforce it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if, theoretically, government didn&apos;t arise out of anarchy,
        anarchy comes with a whole host of problems involving violence, fraud,
        theft, and the destruction of the natural and human environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&apos;t want to get caught up in imagining and constructing worlds
        to illustrate the effects of any one system. That&apos;s how I
        propagandized myself into anarcho-capitalism to begin with. By
        constructing a universe in my imagination governed by a human nature
        that doesn&apos;t exist in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, here&apos;s the point I&apos;m trying to make. I don&apos;t know
        what the hell the answer is to anything. I want to imagine that my
        thought of decentralized capitalist governance in which everyone still
        has a responsibility to their surrounding community is realistic and
        worth thinking about. But it&apos;s not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn&apos;t even say there&apos;s anything wrong with the current
        system. Because I don&apos;t know. I could say that there are a lot of
        things in society that is wrong. I might even have a few things to say
        and a solution or two to suggest. But for the most part, I don&apos;t
        know.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my journey to learn about other people&apos;s beliefs; how people
        think, where they&apos;re coming from, and why they believe what they
        believe I&apos;ve come to fully understand that the most important tool
        we have for solving problems is communication. It gets said often. That
        we just need to talk things through. But it doesn&apos;t happen often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Propagandists on social media are skittish about any hints of
        disagreement. They throw temper tantrums and block people before they
        know what&apos;s going on.
      </p>

        who are all advancing modern thoughts and ideas. They welcome challenge
        and take it head on without allowing ego to get in the way. But they
        don&apos;t hold the answers. Maybe some answers. Or many answers. But
        not the answers. No one does.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that&apos;s why in order to survive as a species, to continue to
        grow, we have to learn to listen to one another. To talk and develop new
        ideas and solutions. To accept solutions that aren&apos;t our own and
        simply be happy that progress is being made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything isn&apos;t going to work out your way in the way you want it
        to. You can&apos;t exist in a vacuum. That&apos;s the thesis I made as
        in anarchist in You&apos;ll Never Have Your Anarchy. I also say that as
        someone that doesn&apos;t know whether anarchy or government is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is definitely a problem with the fact that politicians pay no
        attention to their constituents. Facebook has a &lsquo;Town Hall&rsquo;
        feature that allows you to easily follow your government
        representatives. On mobile, there is a dedicated feed for every post
        they make. Do they ever consult people about policy? Do they openly
        explore ideas they&apos;re unsure of? No, they brag about votes they
        made and send out &ldquo;prayers and wishes&rdquo; during times of
        tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a day-to-day basis, they do the government work to fight for their
        own personal beliefs. Without interacting and collaborating with the
        community on an open level.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a society, we see a problem with a lack of openness and a lack of
        conversation. Extreme politics among the SJW&apos;s and alt-right is a
        small sign of this. When no one is having a real conversation. When
        politicians are selfishly misrepresenting us. When everyone is fighting
        for the self, no progress is made. You get chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m all for individualism. The self should be everyone&apos;s
        primary concern. But the self is not the ego. Nor is it being selfish.
        Throwing temper tantrums because someone might disagree with you is no
        way to move forward. We must balance taking care of ourselves with
        taking care of the community. We must take care of ourselves by taking
        care of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, however you structure society and community, it must take into
        account the paradoxical natures of humanity. The wish of peace with a
        drive towards violence. The wish of individualism with a drive towards
        collectivism.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think any group of people should be able to remove themselves from
        their current system of government and try something new. As long as it
        doesn&apos;t have a negative impact on others. The problem is, it will
        inevitably have a negative impact on others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the whole world should be under one simple, enforceable set of
        rules, as long as it doesn&apos;t grow out of control, and as long as
        it&apos;s possible for people to discuss and implement new things. The
        problem is, it will inevitably grow out of control and restrict the
        possibility of discussing and implementing new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the answer is a balance between both. Maybe what we have now is
        our best march towards perfection. Perfection isn&apos;t possible, but
        moving towards perfection is. Maybe what we should be doing, instead of
        constructing utopian visions of the future, is doing our best to advance
        ideas and thoughts. Maybe what we should be doing is putting one foot in
        front of the other on that slow march towards improvement. Not towards a
        perfect vision of utopia. But towards improvement itself. And maybe we
        should leave the ego behind and start accepting that everything
        isn&apos;t going to work out our way.
