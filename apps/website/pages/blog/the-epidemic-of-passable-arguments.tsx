        When an organization claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical
        force, it is a &lsquo;state.&rsquo; The state is violence.

        &lsquo; [PDF] isn&rsquo;t wrong. The argument itself, and the lecture it
        originates from is a well-formulated description of and perspective on
        politics. If you argue on the premise that the state is a monopoly on
        violence, your argument won&rsquo;t fall apart. But it may have a
        precarious balance.

        Give the video below by Nerdwriter a watch. It&rsquo;s about movies that
        might be good.. but not really. They do everything right, but they
        don&rsquo;t connect. What Nerdwriter sees in movies, is also in
        arguments for libertarianism.

      <p>
        A &lsquo;passable&rsquo; libertarian argument, or &lsquo;passable&rsquo;
        activism does just enough to get attention, and just enough for others
        in the community to consider it &lsquo;correct&rsquo; or &lsquo;doing
        something.&rsquo; Regardless if it has an effect. It&rsquo;s just enough
        to get praise, or in the case of celebritarians, just enough to get
        donations, maintain sponsorships, or sell merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nerdwriter once attributed the epidemic of passable movies to a
        &ldquo;lack of tonal control.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve attributed the epidemic
        of passable arguments to a{' '}

          lack of connection

        . That is, the inability or refusal to take note of who you&rsquo;re
        talking to, listen to them, remain curious about their beliefs, and
        explain your own in a way that they as an individual can connect with.
      </p>
      <h2>Logic Isn&rsquo;t Good Enough</h2>
      <p>
        Many arguments I see, that aren&rsquo;t emotionally charged rants, start
        off by loosely referencing what they&rsquo;re replying to and stretching
        into a &lsquo;logical&rsquo; step-by-step that ultimately concludes with
        a cliche phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don&rsquo;t pay your taxes, you go to jail. If you refuse to go
        to jail, you will be physically forced into jail. If you resist arrest
        you will be beaten into submission. If you use enough physical
        resistance, you can be shot and killed. Taxation and all state actions
        are ultimately backed up by the point of a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
        That argument is correct. But only in a strictly &lsquo;logical&rsquo;
        sense.{' '}
        <strong>
          Logic alone isn&rsquo;t enough to articulate how the world works.
        </strong>{' '}
        Especially the human, social world. That same scenario can still happen
        in a world where there is no monopoly on force, but instead, there is
        competition in a free market.{' '}
        <strong>
          If you explicitly agree to the protection of and adherence to a
          particular set of rules, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that the
          refusal to obey can&rsquo;t escalate to lethal force.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the video, Nerdwriter talks about scenes that make sense, that we can
        relate to, but are just copied emotional arcs from other movies.
        They&rsquo;re not realistic or relevant scenarios when you look at them
        critically. He explains that good movies capture the human experience
        with nuance and insight in a way that can teach us things about
        ourselves, or teach us how to articulate those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of &lsquo;human action&rsquo; taught me a lot about humanity
        and the chaos within it. Grasping the idea of the &lsquo;invisible hand
        of the free market&rsquo; showed me how organization on the small scale
        based on self-interest creates organization on the large scale based on
        collective interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn&rsquo;t start saying &ldquo;taxation is theft,&rdquo; until I
        already understood what that meant. That wasn&rsquo;t an argument that
        taught me anything or helped me understand anything. It&rsquo;s just
        something fun to say. I know it&rsquo;s true that taxation is theft, but
        that statement isn&rsquo;t exactly insightful. It doesn&rsquo;t say
        anything about the current state of humanity. There&rsquo;s no nuance,
        no acute observations. It doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything that you
        didn&rsquo;t already know. It has no effect whatsoever.
      </p>
      <h2>The Normal Vocabulary Isn&rsquo;t Good Enough</h2>
      <p>
        What makes a movie passable, according to Nerdwriter, is that passable
        movies observe real life through the lens of other movies. Passable
        movies draw from a library and vocabulary that people don&rsquo;t use or
        relate to. But it&rsquo;s familiar enough for the viewer to understand.
        Which makes the movie&hellip; passable. They get it. They just
        don&rsquo;t connect with it. Passable movies aren&rsquo;t memorable,
        they don&rsquo;t change you, they just sort of&hellip; pass the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s the same with many libertarian arguments. Taxation is theft,
        collectivism is dangerous, public education is indoctrination, no victim
        no crime. These phrases were built on and collected from previous
        libertarian arguments in the same way that the scenes in passable movies
        were. They make sense, but they don&rsquo;t connect. As Nerdwriter puts
        it, these phrases are &ldquo;
        <strong>
          cobbled together from a weird alternate reality that is only a dim
          echo of our own.
        </strong>
        &rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Movies use cliche scenes to rush through certain plot points in order to
        get to the unique part, the schtick of the movie. But that reduces the
        effect it has on the viewer. Libertarian arguments have also become
        cliche enough that they don&rsquo;t hold any persuasive power over
        anyone. They rush through the build-up, the personalized explanation,
        just to get to the part where they can say, &ldquo;Taxation is
        theft!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        For a short period of time, I wrote ~20 pages per week on a long-form
        blog called &ldquo;AnCapUs.&rdquo; I directly answered questions people
        had about anarcho-capitalism, usually pulled from comments. But I
        started to realize I was repeating myself too often to the same people.
        With careful moderation, I kept my comments full of in-depth discussion.
        Publish 20 pages, spend the rest of the week not only writing the next
        20 but talking about the last. I was creating good conversation, but it
        wasn&rsquo;t getting anybody anywhere. It was just an exercise in
        trading opinions. Nothing was connecting with or affecting anybody.

        . If I come across something unique that intrigues me enough to share
        with everyone, I do so. When something like Nerdriter&rsquo;s passable
        movies video helps me find a new perspective, I try to translate what I
        get out of it. Otherwise, everything I&rsquo;m saying here, you&rsquo;ve
        probably heard before. In fact, I&rsquo;ve said it before.
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use slogans to sell your ideas, have a personal
        conversation.&rdquo; The difference is in the perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should be seeking new ideas from different places in order to help us
        explain and articulate our beliefs in different ways. My goal is not to
        tell 1 million people that taxation is theft. My goal is to find 10
        people, figure out how they think, believe and feel; and then figure the
        perspective that will help them understand. The perspective that will
        persuade them. My goal is to find an original argument for every single
        person I talk to about these ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn&rsquo;t much different than Kevin Kelly&rsquo;s{' '}

        . Find the people you can effect, figure out how to effect them, and
        don&rsquo;t worry about large numbers. Allow that to happen on its own,
        if at all. We don&rsquo;t need celebritarians reaching large amounts of
        people. We need conversation between family, friends, and random
        encounters. A system of small conversations and transfers of ideas.
        Celebritarianism and syndicated activism have not helped libertarianism.

        Ron Paul didn&rsquo;t know why he became popular in 2008 when he&rsquo;d
        been saying the same things for decades. He just showed up to colleges
        and people started to cheer at the names Rothbard and Mises. The ideas
        became popular on their own. Libertarianism as a &ldquo;movement&rdquo;
        lost popularity through embarrassments in activism and scandal in
        infighting. CopBlock, as one example, has struggled with the idea of
        whether it should be violence porn to get the views or concentrate on
        boring legislative battles. In time, it has started to concentrate on
        getting violent or outrageous video and getting people to emotionally
        react, rather than make a change.
      </p>
      <p>
        There&rsquo;s probably a popular Adam Kokesh, Larken rose, or Ron Paul
        video that you clearly remember changing the way you think. In most
        cases, I would challenge that and say that someone you knew personally
        primed you for gaining perspective from that video.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if that isn&rsquo;t true, that video connected with{' '}
        <strong>you</strong>. It wasn&rsquo;t a perfectly formulated argument
        with the right incantation. You can&rsquo;t just share that video every
        week and expect it to have the same effect on others. You can&rsquo;t
        repeat what they said and expect it to convert hundreds. The words they
        used were individualized to them and their experiences. The fact that it
        worked on you says more about you and what effects you than the level of
        persuasiveness that video has.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this is to make a request. If you&rsquo;re going to argue
        for libertarianism or try to persuade others of its ideas, don&rsquo;t
        make &lsquo;passable&rsquo; arguments. Don&rsquo;t speak
        &lsquo;logically&rsquo; and then complain that no one is listening
        because they&rsquo;re dumb or indoctrinated. Instead, step out of the
        world of libertarianism and its library of standard phrases and
        arguments. Look at the library of the person you&rsquo;re talking to,
        and use it. You&rsquo;ll not only gain a new and fascinating perspective
        on your own beliefs, but chances are you&rsquo;ll have a lasting
        impression on those you&rsquo;re trying to persuade.
