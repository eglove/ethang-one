        The following is a summary and analysis of a graduate thesis paper
        written by Michael Russo. It&rsquo;s titled, &ldquo;Satoshi&rsquo;s
        Broken Promise: Conflicting Rhetorics In The bitcoin Ecosystem.&rdquo;
        Russo calls bitcoin, &ldquo;&hellip;yet another digital artifact
        promising revolution while at the same time instituting its own brand of
        control.&rdquo; He claims bitcoin fails in its principles of
        decentralization, bitcoin as property, and anonymity. That being said,
        the following is highly critical of bitcoin, but not a dismissal of the
        technology. I only request that you keep an open mind in considering the
        points below, as I believe they are worth the attention.

          bitcoin is not and should not be held to libertarian principles.
        </NextLink>{' '}
        If we are to accept it as an open technology, as a true alternative to
        the current banking system, we need to accept creative uses of the
        blockchain that are both apolitical, and pro-establishment. Limiting the
        currency to a specific ideal and infighting about its adoption and use
        can only stagnate its rise. However, Russo makes a compelling argument
        for the fact that as bitcoin gains popularity, it becomes more
        vulnerable.
      </p>
      <h2>Can You Keep It?</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1990s during the rise of the internet, people thought the web
        would finally be a place of unregulated freedom. It was a place away
        from government control, a place for liberty. But regulation started to
        appear in the late 90&rsquo;s, branching from independent institutions
        like the W3C. The dream of a free web started to fade. Although the
        internet was and still is a great tool, it does not live up to its
        promise of a liberty paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the internet had great potential for unregulated interaction, its
        major flaw is that it&rsquo;s built by people. In his book &lsquo;

          Code
        </NextLink>
        ,&rsquo; Lawrence Lessig argues, &ldquo;Code will be a central tool in
        this analysis.{' '}
        <strong>
          It will present the greatest threat to both liberal and libertarian
          ideals
        </strong>
        , as well as their greatest promise. We can build, or architect or code
        cyberspace to protect values that we believe are fundamental.{' '}
        <strong>
          Or we can build, or architect or code cyberspace to allow those values
          to disappear.
        </strong>
        &rdquo; If the internet is the bastion of freedom, that freedom can
        easily be taken away so long as the code can be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessig&rsquo;s point echoes that of Benjamin Franklin regarding the
        newly created &ldquo;more free&rdquo; United States. Franklin was asked
        when he was leaving the constitutional convention of 1787, &ldquo;Well,
        Doctor, what have we got &ndash; a Republic or a Monarchy?&rdquo;
        Franklin replied, &ldquo;A Republic, if you can keep it.&rdquo; The
        people were tasked to maintain the ideals of the constitution, and they
        failed. Just as I believe bitcoin will fail, and as Russo believes
        bitcoin has already failed.
      </p>
      <h2>What Can The Government Do?</h2>
      <p>
        Through the US Department of Defense and the Domain Name System
        protocol, the government is able to completely shut down websites that
        contain information or content disagreeable to them. If they are unable
        to shut down a website, they can suspend it at the registrar level and
        prevent all user access. That&rsquo;s what happened to the Liberty
        Reserve dollar in 2013, which promptly led to its destruction. Bitcoin,
        of course, has stronger defenses than the Liberty Reserve, but
        we&rsquo;ll get back to that.

          more than a third of all bitcoin nodes exist in the United States

        bitcoin, they would have a significant impact on the health of bitcoin
        all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a user stores their bitcoin on a US-based server, such as with
        Coinbase, they are vulnerable to US law. The US may currently consider
        bitcoin legal, but that could change at any time. As an example of the
        impact governments can have on bitcoin, we can consider Russia. The
        Russian government{' '}

        Obviously, the blockchain does not require DNS. It only requires that
        the blockchain file can be transferred in some manner. It&rsquo;s stored
        on a peer-to-peer level and can not be blocked or deleted on a whim. The
        government could make it illegal to download and store the blockchain.
        Maybe on the grounds that{' '}

          people have put links to child pornography on it

        . Illegalizing bitcoin in that manner would only help drive the bitcoin
        economy further underground. It would indeed become a tool mostly for
        criminals. Bitcoin itself would most likely never go away, but its
        popularity could be significantly damaged by such legal action.
      </p>
      <h2>&ldquo;Decentralization&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>
        While the government is the largest external enemy to bitcoin, it is not
        its largest enemy. Its biggest weaknesses are internal, and related to
        the people who use it. A few elite coders control bitcoin and its
        direction as a board. The existence of a few people trying to maintain
        the original ideals of Satoshi Nakamoto&nbsp;is bitcoins Achilles heel.
        Just as the constitution&apos;s greatest weakness was the people&rsquo;s
        ability to maintain the ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin at its core requires a communal consensus. All users must agree
        to the ledger through a verification process. Over time, it becomes more
        expensive to participate in this process. Casual users are becoming more
        limited in their usage of bitcoin because of that
        &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; process of verification. The blockchain is
        currently over 65GB. Computing blocks for monetary rewards has become
        completely out of the question for individual users, doing so requires
        massive server farms. As bitcoin grows, the groups of organizations that
        have the power to find new blocks become smaller. With that, there is a
        greater risk that they can refuse to validate transactions, raise fees,
        and slow the bitcoin economy. Former bitcoin developer{' '}

          Mike Hearn explains all of this far better than I can.
        </NextLink>{' '}
        [Must read.] To summarize Hearns points, the network is already
        controlled by a few elites who have out-competed the use bitcoin was
        built for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of a block is currently, and arbitrarily set at 1MB in size.
        But with a large number of transactions, that small size has caused data
        congestion. Downloading larger single files rather than many smaller
        files could get rid of that congestion. Despite the fact that the
        majority of bitcoin users seem to want to increase the size of a block,
        a small minority of miners in China have refused to do so. (See
        Hearn&rsquo;s article linked above.) When representatives from Coinbase
        expressed a preference to increase the block size on the official
        bitcoin forums, the message was very literally deleted because Coinbase
        &ldquo;picked the wrong side.&rdquo; They were even banned from the
        online community for making the suggestion. In fact, it is commonplace
        for people to be banned from the BitcoinTalk forums for suggesting
        changes that the developers find &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; or for talking
        about forking the code to make something new. Bitcoin&rsquo;s
        open-source structure, which still requires lead developer approval for
        all changes, has not, in any way, succeeded at removing authority from
        the currency.

          theory of &ldquo;selfish mining&rdquo;
        </NextLink>{' '}
        as a weakness to bitcoins infrastructure, it was dismissed as a
        practical impossibility. [Must read.] But as casual users keep moving to
        lite software, without downloading the whole blockchain, that theory
        becomes more practical over time. Users who don&rsquo;t want to, or can
        not download and support the entire blockchain system, are handing over
        their power to a network of elites who can. It is they who represent
        their transactions by publishing them to the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it once seemed impossible, there is a conceivable time in the
        future that a single miner could hold 51% control of the network and use
        the power to double-spend, reverse transactions, and devalue the
        currency. Bitcoin fans defend the 51% problem by saying no one would
        attack the network in this way because they would be attacking their own
        currency and its value.
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Dowd of Durham University replied to that by saying,</p>
      <blockquote>
        Arguments to the effect that no one would engage in behavior that
        threatened the system, because everyone has a stake in it, are based on
        simplistic assumptions about the self-interests of the parties concerned
        &hellip; This statement will &hellip; ultimately prove to be
        bitcoin&rsquo;s death knell. Bitcoin, the ultimate system designed to
        avoid the need for trust, is now reduced to relying on the trust in the
        dominant mining pool not to attack it.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mt. Gox represents the problem with casual users moving towards a
        centralized agency to store and manage bitcoin when they can&rsquo;t, or
        are unwilling to do so. When users lost money on the Mt. Gox crash, they
        had no choice but to appeal to government authorities in order to try
        and get it back. That third-party system of protection does not
        currently exist for bitcoin. Which makes even fiat a safer option in the
        long run.
      </p>
      <h2>The Question of Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        In a{' '}
        <NextLink
          linkProperties={{

          Financial Cryptography &amp; Data Security study
        </NextLink>
        , it was found that 45% of bitcoin exchanges like Mt. Gox go bankrupt
        and disappear. Of eleven exchanges that researchers looked at, five of
        them did not reimburse customers, six claim to have done so, but provide
        no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This record is why companies like Coinbase and Bitpay sought government
        regulation. So they could offer transaction insurance and penetrate a
        more mainstream user base. However, that also puts their users under the
        view of government regulation, strictly controlled by the law and the
        DNS structure mentioned earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea that bitcoin is going to replace the banking institutions and
        bring down the government is naive. At best, it&rsquo;s an early, still
        growing version of the very institutions it claims it will destroy. At
        worst, it&rsquo;s another addition to the current system. Users could
        keep creating &ldquo;alt-coins,&rdquo; but the foundational technology
        of the blockchain still remains. And unfortunately, that technology is
        flawed. In order to make sure instant transactions remain possible,
        despite the block size problem and other problems, companies like
        Coinbase avoid using the blockchain altogether. They keep transactions
        local and trade directly, or in chunks. Coinbase has already had to fix
        a problem with one of bitcoin&rsquo;s major features.
      </p>
      <p>Michael Russo notes,</p>
      <blockquote>
        It would seem that anarcho-libertarian bitcoin users are at an impasse.
        On the one hand, they might run a node on a home computer, doing little
        to protect their property from the manipulations of elite mining farms.
        On the other hand, they can relinquish their property rights to
        hierarchically structured, corporate clearing houses like Coinbase, who
        promise both protection and convenience at the cost of economic
        autonomy. In either case, in the current ecosystem, the claim that
        bitcoin is property is a misleading ideal. Casual bitcoin users are at
        risk of being subjected to the same unfair monetary practices of the
        coercive social institutions they seek to circumvent.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>&ldquo;Privacy&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin also fails by way of privacy. Not just because the casual user
        who is driven towards Coinbase is required to give up their identity,
        but because{' '}
        <NextLink
          linkProperties={{
            href: 'http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39884-1_4#page-1',
          }}
        >
          40% of bitcoin users can be identified with very basic investigative
          techniques
        </NextLink>
        . Even if those users create a new address for every transaction. Yes,
        bitcoin offers encryption, and if people use other privacy methods in
        just the right way, all the time, they can remain anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practicality of people being able to do that, especially the average
        person and casual user who merely wishes to use the currency to make
        trades, is basically nil. With all the anonymizing software, VPN
        tunnels, and public WiFi usage, you eventually have to connect to the
        network and make your entire transaction history and its patterns
        visible. Ross Ulbricht fell to this major security flaw. The idea of a
        public ledger on an anonymous currency is contradictory. You can not
        have an open economy&nbsp;and an anonymous one too. Saying that Bitcoin
        is anonymous, if you use encryption correctly all the time, is as
        impractical as communists saying financial incentive isn&rsquo;t an
        issue if everyone just stopped caring about financial incentives.
      </p>
      <h2>Tools Don&rsquo;t Have Principles, Users Do</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, bitcoin claims to be anti-establishment&nbsp;but
        houses bureaucracy and control from elites. It promises P2P cash with no
        third-party trust agents, but users face a choice between trusting a
        minority of users who hold power over the network or placing trust in
        regulated companies like Coinbase and Bitpay. Bitcoin claims anonymity
        but transactions are easily traceable through social engineering unless
        users use a great deal of effort and resources through multiple
        third-party apps that claim to make them anonymous. A public transaction
        is always public, and still traceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russo&rsquo;s glaring point remains, Bitcoin has created a class
        hierarchy divided by computational power. The cryptocurrency as is can
        not deliver on the promises of decentralization, anonymity, or full
        control over property. And I agree with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        No tool in the world can usher in a new set of principles and destroy
        the structures and traditions that others have used for centuries.
        Bitcoin offers a new idea of competition in money. With competition in
        third-party financial insurance and protection, bitcoin could be better.
        But with all facts considered, I see bitcoin only as a fascinating first
        step towards monetary liberty. Neither I or Russo aim to insult or
        degrade its ideals and current position and uses as a tool. By
        recognizing that bitcoin itself has made no difference at all, but
        instead gave people the confidence and means to interact outside of
        government control, we can recognize that bitcoins biggest flaw, people,
        is also its greatest strength. Whatever means you use to avoid or fight
        against the state is a personal choice. The tools you use aren&rsquo;t
        doing the work or making the difference, you are. Just remember that
        nothing you do makes you immune to government interference, fraud,
        theft, or monetary instability.
